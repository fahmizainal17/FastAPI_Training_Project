# In FastAPI, "metadata" refers to data about data, which provides additional context or information about the structure and properties of your API. Metadata in FastAPI can be used in various ways to enhance the documentation, management, and discoverability of the API. Here are some key uses of metadata in FastAPI:

# 1. **API Documentation**: Metadata is extensively used to enrich the automatically generated API documentation (such as Swagger UI and Redoc). You can add descriptions, examples, and more detailed information about the API endpoints, request bodies, and responses.

# 2. **Endpoint Description**: You can use metadata to describe individual API operations. For instance, by using the `summary` and `description` parameters in the route decorators, you can provide concise and detailed descriptions of what an endpoint does.

# 3. **Response and Field Descriptions**: Metadata can be added to response models and fields to provide more details in the documentation, such as explanations of field purposes or constraints.

# 4. **Tags**: Tags are a form of metadata that help organize endpoints into groups in the documentation, making the API easier to navigate and understand.

# 5. **Additional Responses**: You can specify additional response descriptions and status codes using metadata to inform clients about other possible outcomes of the API calls.

# Hereâ€™s a simple example to demonstrate adding metadata to a FastAPI application:


from fastapi import FastAPI, Path
from pydantic import BaseModel

app = FastAPI()

class Item(BaseModel):
    name: str
    description: str = None
    price: float
    tax: float = None

@app.post("/items/", summary="Create an item", response_description="The created item details")
async def create_item(item: Item):
    """
    Create an item with all the information:

    - **name**: each item must have a name
    - **description**: a long description is optional
    - **price**: required field
    - **tax**: optional tax information
    """
    return {"name": item.name, "price": item.price, "tax": item.tax}

@app.get("/items/{item_id}", summary="Get an item", response_description="Detailed information about the item")
async def read_item(item_id: int = Path(..., title="The ID of the item to get", description="Must be a positive integer")):
    """
    Fetch a single item by its id (a positive integer).
    """
    return {"item_id": item_id}

# In this example, metadata is used to enhance the API documentation by adding summaries, detailed descriptions, and specific annotations for path parameters and models. This makes the API self-descriptive and improves the developer experience.
